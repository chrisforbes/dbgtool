Ijw.Cricket Stuff To Do (for v1.0)
==================================

		* = not done	# = done	? = sortof

# Make Detach actually work (process currently dies!)
* Allow Pause/Stop/Detach in Running state as well as Paused - requires DebugBreakProcess for Pause!
# Fix crash on shutdown with Running target
* Do art for buttons
* Breakpoints
* Modules and Threads - do we just use the System.Diagnostics.Process stuff for this?
* Handle DebugEventCode.ExitProcess properly (currently we get stuck!)
* Stack Walking - Stack-as-data visualization?
* Show Disassembly
* Single-Stepping via Context manipulation
* Show Context (Control, Integer, FPU, MMX, SSE regs)
* Basic-Block Decomposition for Disassembly
* Read & Alter Target Memory
* Memory map view (module layout, page permissions, heaps)
* Load symbols for shared libraries (dbghelp.dll ?)
* Resolve addresses etc in disassembly to symbols wherever possible
* Defining Synthetic Symbols
* Auto-collapsing of 0xcc / 0x90 slack-space runs.
* Inline basic-block graph
* Assemble instructions into target memory
* Color-coding instruction types
* Annotation of conditional branches with C-ified condition
* Auto breakpoint modes: blocks, functions, etc
* Show multiple threads in code view
* Thread-Local Storage Management (fs:0)
* Selectively break on exceptions or pass to the target
* Stealth mode (hook IsDebuggerPresent, etc)
* Tools for COM proxying
* Tools for struct memory visualization
* Track changes to original binaries and export patches
* Data Breakpoints
